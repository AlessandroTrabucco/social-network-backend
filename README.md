# social-network-backend
Express JS application, backend of my social network react project that you can access here https://github.com/AlessandroTrabucco/social-network-frontend.
This application authenticates a client using a Json Web Token, and after that the client can access all public posts, send request to create, update and delete posts. I have also used Socket.IO to allow a user to have a real time chat.
